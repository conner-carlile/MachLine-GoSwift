# MachLine
MachLine (Multi-order Approach to Calculating High-speed Linear aerodynamics) is a modern, unstructured, subsonic/supersonic flow solver currently being developed by the AeroLab. It is a linear panel method based on the Prandtl-Glauert equation. MachLine will implement many features not available in legacy compressible panel methods, such as unstructured meshes, iterative matrix solvers, automatic wake modelling, low-order singularity distributions, and more.

THIS SOFTWARE COMES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED.

MachLine is under active development and is not yet fully capable. We anticipate development to be completed sometime in the summer of 2023. As new features are added, the documentation will be updated accordingly. Please refer to the documentation for the full scope of features currently available in MachLine.

## Documentation
Documentation can be found on the [MachLine Wiki](https://github.com/usuaero/MachLine/wiki). There, you'll find instructions on how to compile and run MachLine, an overview of the theory and implementation, and references to relevant literature to help with gaining a deeper understanding of linear panel methods.
