# TriPan
TriPan (Triangular Panel Aerodynamics) is a modern, unstructured, subsonic/supersonic flow solver currently being developed by the AeroLab. It is a linear panel method based on the Prandtl-Glauert equation. TriPan will implement many features not available in legacy compressible panel methods, such as unstructured meshes, iterative matrix solvers, automatic wake modelling, low-order singularity distributions, and more.

TriPan is under active development and is not yet fully capable. We anticipate development to be completed sometime in the summer of 2023. As new features are added, the documentation will be updated accordingly. Please refer to the documentation for the full scope of features currently available in TriPan.

## Documentation
Documentation can be found on the [Tripan Wiki](https://github.com/usuaero/TriPan/wiki). There, you'll find instructions on how to compile and run TriPan, an overview of the theory and implementation, and references to relevant literature to help with gaining a deeper understanding of linear panel methods.
